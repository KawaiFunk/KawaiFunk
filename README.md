- 👋 Hi, I’m Dan.
- 👀 I’m really interested in C# and love exploring all the things you can create with it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can about C#, from the basics to the more advanced topics. It’s exciting to see how everything comes together.
- 💞️ I’m open to working on fun and interesting C# projects or teaming up with others who share the same passion.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at dandamian646@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play the guitar! It’s my go-to way to relax and recharge when I need a break from coding.
